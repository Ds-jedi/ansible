include_tasks: Includes a file with a list of tasks to be executed in 
               the current playbook.

import_tasks: Imports a list of tasks to be added to the current playbook 
              for subsequent execution.
##############################################################################
All import* statements are pre-processed at the time playbooks are parsed.
All include* statements are processed as they encountered during the execution 
of the playbook.
##############################################################################
So import is static, include is dynamic.
##############################################################################
there are several playbooks and I want to add same pre_tasks and 
post_tasks to those playbooks. so I add the import_tasks to playbooks.
##############################################################################
I need to run this play in the middle of the playbook because it 
is dependent on a prior task and a subsequent task depends on it 
(otherwise I'd break it up differently) 
##############################################################################
Letâ€™s say that there are some common roles that you would like to include across 
all your different server types. You could create a common_roles.yml
And then include it in your other playbooks to reduce repetition and keep your 
playbooks DRY:

---
- hosts: web                                      # ./web.yml
- import_playbook: common_roles.yml
  name: configure web servers
  roles:
    - nginx
    - my_site

---                                        # ./database.yml
- hosts: database
- import_playbook: common_roles.yml  
  name: configure database servers
  roles:
    - postgres
